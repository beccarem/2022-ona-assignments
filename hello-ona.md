## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to
GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and
a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## Warning: package 'tidyverse' was built under R version 4.1.2

    ## -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.1 --

    ## v ggplot2 3.3.5     v purrr   0.3.4
    ## v tibble  3.1.4     v dplyr   1.0.7
    ## v tidyr   1.1.4     v stringr 1.4.0
    ## v readr   2.0.2     v forcats 0.5.1

    ## -- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
library(igraph)
```

```

    ## [1] "Hello network!"

``` r

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](hello-ona_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
